Description: For multiple testing.
    Computes estimates and confidence bounds for the
    False Discovery Proportion (FDP), the fraction of false positives among
    all rejected hypotheses.
    The methods in the package use permutations of the data. Doing so, they
    take into account the dependence structure in the data.
